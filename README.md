# Simple TCP and UDP Examples in Java

This repository contains simple examples of TCP and UDP client-server communication implemented in Java.


## Introduction

This project provides basic examples of TCP and UDP communication between a server and a client in Java. The examples demonstrate how to establish a connection, send messages, and handle communication.

## TCP Example

### TCPServer.java

The `TCPServer` class represents a simple TCP server that listens on a specified port and receives a message from a connected client.

### TCPClient.java

The `TCPClient` class represents a simple TCP client that connects to a server on a specified address and port and sends a message to the server.

## UDP Example

### UDPServer.java

The `UDPServer` class represents a simple UDP server that listens on a specified port and continuously receives messages from clients.

### UDPClient.java

The `UDPClient` class represents a simple UDP client that sends a message to a server on a specified address and port.
